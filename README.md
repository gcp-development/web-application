# Work in Progress

## Motivation

There is no "one-size-fits-all" for any technology and everything comes down to "what we are trying to solve?". For Web3, we are dealing with distributed applications working on distributed software infrastructure (P2P networks). Meaning right from the start we our mandatory requirements are "resource-efficient","minimize latency" and "support high concurrency". In business terms this means if we are going to lose money is we don't get the right trade-off in our technology selection. For startups these technical choices and trade-offs will be crucial in their product development and ability to scale.
